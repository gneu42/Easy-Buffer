## What is it ?

**Easy-Buffer** is based on single loop buffer like Quiver or the Prusa MMU2 Filament Retract Bank. 
It consists of :
  * 150mm high stackable buffer towers.
  * A interface block.
  * 3 individual heads.
        The heads are composed of :
        * a case with cover.
        * a wheel.
        * a filament guide.
        * a lever.
        * an magnetic PTFE output.

Using the pre-gate function of Happy Hare, the loading of the filament in the ERCF takes only a few seconds from the insertion into the buffer and the parking in the filament block.

Just move the lever to the **L** position, and insert the filament until it reaches the ERCF gate. Happy Hare pull it and push it back to the parking position. At this moment, filp the lever to the **B** position. And it is done, ready for printing.
